### To Do

- audit_preproc_rx
    - Find where work_mount is based on Tapis job execution system
    - Lots of testing
    - Key points
        - Job resubmission occurs if neither of the following exceed 3:
            - # of error files in archivePath
                - status=FAILED would bypass
            - # status: FAILED || FINISHED messages sent to MPJ
                - Would bypass if MPJ is slow (indexing, long message queue, etc.)
        - The preprocessing reactor needs to (minimally) send `&mpjId={mpjId}&status=${JOB_STATUS}&tapis_jobId=${JOB_ID}` to:
            - audit_preproc_rx webhook (doesn't need job status actually)
            - mpj.callback (doesn't need its own ID)
- audit_align_rx
- pipeline_uuids
    - preproc = `106d3f7f-07dc-596f-86f9-df75083e52cc`
    - align = `106bd127-e2d2-57ac-b9be-11ed06042e68`
    - df = `106231a1-0c78-5067-b53b-11a33f4e1495`
- `datacatalog_job_uuid=10779ebc-db12-5eac-9fcf-03deb2cb0c70`
    - preproc job FINISHED on 6/13/2019
