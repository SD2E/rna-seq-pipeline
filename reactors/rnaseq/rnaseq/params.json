## Parameters explained
Trimmomatic
      trim         -   Yes/no, perform the trimmomatic step (99.9% of time this is yes)
      paired       -   Paired reads or single-end reads
      adaptersfile -   Adapters used in the experiment that may contaminate some reads (fasta file)
      minlen       -   Minimum length of reads to keep for downstream processing. RiboSeq in our work has useful reads
                   -   as short as 23bp while RNASeq averages higher. Captures shorter fragments (sgRNA).
SortMeRNA
      sortmerna    -   Yes/no, perform sortmerna step (99.9% of time yes)
      filterseqs   -   Sequence files to use during filter, comma separated
      threads      -   Compute threads
